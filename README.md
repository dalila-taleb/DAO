# DAO PROJECT

## What we will make
1. To be able to purchase NFTs automatically when a proposal is passed, you need an on-chain NFT marketplace that you can call a purchase() function on. There exist a lot of NFT marketplaces out there, but to avoid overcomplicating things, we will create a simplified fake NFT marketplace for this tutorial as the focus is on the DAO.
2. We will also make the actual DAO smart contract using Hardhat.
3. We will make the website using Next.js to allow users to create and vote on proposals
